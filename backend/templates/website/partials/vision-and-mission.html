<h1>About Shalom School</h1>
As the motto of the school is "Honesty, Peace and Excellence" this school was started with the thought that we provide the children of this small village with quality education and values. It is purely not for profit institution, where love, care and education and values. It is purely not for profit institution, where love, care and education are far too near than the capital. At present the school has 70 students and 8 teaching staffs, 1 accountant and 1 support staff. The school has classes from nursery till class eight.
The school was build on the roof top of a cow shed due to insufficient finance. But now we've well build good class rooms with sufficient spaces.
